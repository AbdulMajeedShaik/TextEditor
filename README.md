TextEditor Project Description:

The TextEditor project is a basic text editor application developed in Java using the Swing library. It provides users with a graphical user interface for creating, editing, and saving text files. The main features and components of this text editor include:

User Interface: The text editor's user interface is built using Java Swing components, creating a modern and user-friendly design.

Menu Bar: The application includes a menu bar at the top of the window with two main menus: "File" and "Edit."

File Operations:

Open File: Users can open existing text files from their local filesystem using the "Open File" menu option. The program displays the content of the selected file in the text area.
Save File: Users can save the content of the text area to a new or existing file using the "Save File" menu option. The program supports the creation of new files and appending ".txt" to the filenames if not provided.
New Window: Users can open a new instance of the text editor in a separate window by selecting the "New Window" menu option.
Text Editing Features:

Cut, Copy, and Paste: The application provides standard text editing functionality, allowing users to cut, copy, and paste text within the text area.
Select All: Users can select all text within the text area using the "Select All" menu option.
Text Area: The central part of the application is a JTextArea component that serves as the text editing area. It supports vertical and horizontal scrolling as needed.

Custom Component Positioning: The application uses a null layout for custom component positioning, giving developers full control over the layout and placement of UI elements.

Exit on Close: When the user closes the application window, it exits gracefully using System.exit(0).

Event Handling: The TextEditor class implements the ActionListener interface to handle menu item actions. It performs actions like cutting, copying, pasting, selecting all, and closing the application based on user interactions with the menu items.

File Choosers: File choosers are used to facilitate opening and saving files. Users can browse their local file system to select files for opening or saving.

Overall, this TextEditor project provides a basic but functional text editing experience in a Java Swing-based GUI. It can serve as a foundation for more advanced text editor applications with additional features and improvements.
